### Hi there 👋

I'm Shaun, I'm currently a candidate for Master of Business Analytics at MIT, class of 2021. I'm primarily interested in working in the tech industry with the aim to increase social good. Particular fields I find interesting are smart cities and education, but my interests are definitely not limited to this.
